# The Magic of Blue Tea

In the world of fine herbal infusions, few botanicals entrance the senses like Butterfly Pea (Clitoria Ternatea).

## Why Anthocyanin Antioxidants Matter

Blue Tea derives its rich indigo pigment from potent anthocyanins—the same antioxidants found in wild blueberries and acai berries.

- **Skin Glow**: Fights oxidative stress and preserves natural skin elasticity.
- **Mental Clarity**: Calms nervous tension without causing drowsiness.
- **Natural Color Shifting**: PH-sensitive polyphenols turn royal purple when infused with fresh lemon juice!

## How to Brew the Perfect Sapphire Cup

1. Steep 1 Blue Tea bag in 200ml of hot water (85°C) for 4 minutes.
2. Inhale the soothing botanical aroma.
3. Squeeze fresh lemon juice for a magical color transformation and citrus kick!

- **Neem Leaves**: Gentle cleansing botanical compounds that support daily body balance.

## How to Integrate into Your Routine

# Warming Spices for Daily Wellness

Spices have been used for centuries to warm the body, assist digestion, and bring soothing aroma to daily tea rituals.

## The Goodness of Ginger & Cinnamon

In PrimeBrew Herbis Blue Tea with Ginger & Cinnamon, two powerful botanicals come together:

- **Sun-Dried Ginger Root**: Known for warming the stomach, easing abdominal discomfort after meals, and supporting natural metabolic rhythm.
- **Ceylon Cinnamon Bark**: A fragrant bark rich in natural polyphenols that helps maintain balanced energy levels throughout the day without caffeine jitters.
- **Butterfly Pea Flowers**: Rich in anthocyanin antioxidants that complement the warming spices with gentle cellular support.

## How to Enjoy Your Warming Infusion

1. Steep 1 Tea Bag in 200ml of hot water (95°C / 203°F) for 4 to 6 minutes.
2. Inhale the warm, spicy aroma of ginger and true Ceylon cinnamon.
3. Sip warm on chilly mornings or after main meals for comforting digestive support.
